# Data_visualization.py
This Python script generates random marks for five students across four subjects — Math, Science, Biology, and Chemistry — using NumPy. It calculates the total marks for each student, stores the data in a pandas DataFrame, and visualizes the total marks using a bar chart created with matplotlib.
